# State Machine for Unity
State Machine for Unity is a simple, open-source state machine designed for the Unity game engine. 

This project separates the concern of states and  transitions, creating a more modular and easy-to-follow structure when writing a state machine mostly through code.

# Components
The core of the state machien is found in the root `StateMachine` folder.

- `StateMachine.cs`
- `AState.cs`
- `ATransition.cs`
- `StateType.cs`

The `States` and `Transitions` folder contains example states and transitions, while the `EnemyController.cs` shows and example of how to set up a patrolling guard.
